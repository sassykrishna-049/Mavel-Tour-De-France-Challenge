### ABOUT
The Tour de France is an iconic annual cycling race held in France. Spanning over three weeks in July, it covers approximately 3,500 kilometers and consists of 21 stages, including flat, hilly, and mountainous terrain. Established in 1903, it attracts top cyclists from around the world who compete for the coveted yellow jersey, awarded to the overall leader. The race weaves through picturesque landscapes, challenging riders both physically and mentally. It has become a symbol of endurance, teamwork, and determination, drawing millions of spectators and enthusiasts globally. The Tour de France remains an unparalleled showcase of cycling prowess and a celebrated sporting event worldwide.

I will be playing the role of Data Visualization Expert at the **Amaury Sport Organisation**, the company that organizes the annual **Tour de France** cycling race.

While the Tour de France is one of the most watched live sporting events in the world, most viewership comes from European countries. My goal is to help increase the race's popularity around the world by creating an infographic-style visual to educate new viewers, highlight the magnitude of the event, and build anticipation for this year's race.
